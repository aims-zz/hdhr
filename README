Problem:
The HD Homerun tools bundled (at least on Mac OS X) only lets you set the
channel by the physical channel ID.  The virtual channel is what people are
actually familiar with though.

Solution:
Throw together a Python script to map from virtual channel to a physical
channel and program number.  So, for example, 2.1 maps to channel 44 program 3.
